# essentials

my personal take on a minimal web app bootstrapper

## What it gives you (ðŸ¦„ TODO ðŸ¦„)

- Typescript
- React
- Webpack
- Tslint
- Prettier
- "create" script via npm

## Maybe (still deciding if I should add them, it won't be minimal if I add boilerplate)

- Emotion
- Redux
- Jest
- Hot reloading (I don't personally like this)
- my personal vscode settings/recommended extensions
