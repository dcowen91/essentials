# essentials

my personal take on a minimalist client starter kit

## What it gives you (todo ðŸ¦„)

- Typescript
- React
- Webpack (webpack-serve and webpack-cli)
- Tslint
- Prettier

## Maybe (still deciding if I should add them, it won't be minimal if I add boilerplate)

- Emotion
- Redux
- Jest
- my personal vscode settings/recommended extensions etc
