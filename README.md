# essentials

my personal take on a minimal web app bootstrapper

## How to use

This is a github repository template. simply click on the "Use this template button", then you are good to go!

`npm run start // Start dev server`

`npm run compile // Build project`

## Why?

Create-React-App doesn't quite suit my needs. It is missing some things I like, and has some features I never use or disagree with. I end up tweaking the default config,adding and removing the same set of items any time I use it. Creating my own template that I can easily re-use to avoid having to do those tweaks every time is worth it for me.

## What it gives you (ðŸ¦„ TODO ðŸ¦„)

- [x] Typescript
